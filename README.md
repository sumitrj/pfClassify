## Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression

The aim of this project is to predict a patientâ€™s severity of decline in lung function based on a CT scan of their lungs. 

Lung function is assessed based on output from a spirometer, which measures the forced vital capacity (FVC), i.e. the volume of air exhaled.
